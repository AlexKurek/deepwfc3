DeepWFC3: Analyzing HST/WFC3 Images using Machine Learning
--------

`deepwfc3` contains all of the software for building deep learning models using data from the Hubble Space Telescopes (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3).

The projects includes all of the models we have built to date. This includes well documented data processing scripts, Jupyter Notebooks, and appropriate README.md files with a brief project overview and links to relevant Instrument Science Reports (ISRs).

Here are a list of completed models:
- WFC3/IR Blob Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- WFC3/UVIS Figure 8 Classification using CNNs
