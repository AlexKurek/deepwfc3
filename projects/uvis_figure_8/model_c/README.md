This model uses 3 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers.  The model was first trained on synthetic data where figure 8's were inserted onto images randomly [ISR REF HERE].  After converging to a high accuracy on the synthetic data, the parameters of the convolutional layers were frozen, though the parameters were allowed to vary.  The fully connected layers were then retrained on real data.
